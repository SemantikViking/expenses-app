- **Priority:** High
- **Completed Phases:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 4A, 4B, 5
- **Estimated Timeline:** 3-4 weeks remaining for background processing, testing, and deployment

### Key Dependencies
- Pydantic AI for structured data extraction
- OpenAI API key for vision processing
- Python 3.9+ with modern typing support
- macOS 12.0+ for file system monitoring
- SMTP server access for email integration
- Payment system API access (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.) - optional

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with simple file monitoring before adding AI
- Test with sample receipts early and often
- Implement comprehensive error handling from the beginning
- Keep configuration flexible for different use cases
- Build email and payment features as optional modules
- Test status transitions thoroughly to prevent invalid states
- Implement proper backup and recovery for JSON log files
